\section{Conclusions}

Our experiments provide insights into the practical performance of Newton-type methods for large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. The Modified Newton Method, while robust, can suffer from inefficiencies when dealing with ill-conditioned Hessians, particularly in the banded trigonometric function.
On the other hand, the Truncated Newton Method, which relies on iterative solutions to the Newton system, generally achieves better computational efficiency, particularly for high-dimensional problems.
However, it is more sensitive to preconditioning, which significantly influences its convergence rate and stability.

Finite difference approximations, though useful in the absence of exact derivatives, introduce additional computational costs and potential inaccuracies, particularly when the step size is not chosen carefully.
