# Stochastic Optimization Assignment

The code in this repository finds solution for 7 test instances of the IHTC 2024.
This proposal implements the Tabu Search metaheuristic as solver.

## Project structure
The code provides an `Hospital.py` instance, which represents the problem status, with its constraints and associated penalty.
In order to compute the solutions, the program provides a `Tabu.py` solver.

## Requirements

The requirements to run the code can be found in `requirements.txt`.

## Compute solutions

In order to compute the solution files, it is sufficient to execute `main.py`.
